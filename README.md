[Materialize](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize) is a streaming database for real-time applications. It is wire-compatible with PostgreSQL, which means that you can connect to a Materialize instance using your favorite client libraries, ORM frameworks and other third-party tools that support PostgreSQL.

This repo is a collection of reference examples for common language-specific PostgreSQL drivers and PostgreSQL-compatible ORMs that have been tested with Materialize.
